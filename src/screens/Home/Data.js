      'The suit was designed as a pacemaker to keep shrapnel from reaching Stark’s heart, and as in the movie, was used to escape his captors. Stark held onto the armor for a while in the comics, and painted it gold because its initial gray was too scary.',

      'The Mk. II was our first sight of the repulsor technology that would be in later iterations, and led to one of the best scenes in the original Iron Man. In the comics, the Mk. II was made after fighting Mister Doll, when Tony realized that the original armor was too cumbersome. One of the Mk. II models was later melted down to help create the Mk. 37.',

      'The very first Iron Man armor to contain repulsor rays and a faceplate in the comics, the Mk. III managed to last 11 years before it had to be replaced. As we see in the movie, it’s the first complete version of the Iron Man armor, granted the red-and-gold color scheme and used to both defeat the Ten Rings terrorists and Obadiah Stane, aka the Iron Monger. This was the last armor in the comics that Stark wore before he got his first solo book.',

      'A battle with the supervillain known as the Freak destroyed the Mk. III armor. The Mk. IV is one of the models with the longest lifespan, and was worn by Stark’s friend James Rhodes during his tenure as Iron Man. This is typically Stark’s backup suit whenever his modern armors fail him. In Iron Man 2, Stark wore the Mk. IV for most of the film until he completed the Mk. VI.',

      'Another suit that has very little similarities between its two versions, the Mk. VI was made in the comics specifically for underwater excursions. Everything was reworked to function in the ocean depths, plus the ability to jettison its wearer if escape was needed.',

      'After AIM recreated that pesky Extremis virus that he’d dealt with in the comics some years back, Stark decided to go and destroy every sample he could find. His new nonlethal Stealth Suit was created to help him covertly destroy a sample kept in a Columbian drug dealer’s mansion (like ya do). The suit in Age of Ultron, meanwhile, is just a recolored version of his Mk. 42 from his last movie.',

      'His Endo-Sym armor was based primarily off symbiote biology and wrapped around his body like liquid metal. Infinity War’s equivalent of the Mk. 50, however, was based on nanotech that adapted to his thoughts, giving him the ability to instantly form a variety of weapons.',
